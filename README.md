Calm Connect is a comprehensive web app designed to bridge the gap between individuals seeking emotional support and mental health assistance with professional therapists. 
The idea is to create a web app that connects people with mental health issues and people who need emotional support to therapists.  The web app would also help prospective users track their progress and development in achieving mental and emotional wellness.  
It would include a community where users can interact with each other and be able to share tips on how they have been able to achieve mental and emotional wellness. 
Users would be able to schedule appointments with therapists and choose whether they want to have sessions online or in person.
Whether you prefer in-person sessions or the convenience of online therapy,Calm  Connect offers a seamless and supportive experience tailored to your needs.
